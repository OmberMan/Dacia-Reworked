They believe they are immortal forever living in the following sense: they think they do not die and that the one who dies joins Zalmoxis, a divine being; some call this same divine being Gebeleizis. Every four years, they send a messenger to Zalmoxis, who is chosen by chance. They ask him to tell Zalmoxis what they want on that occasion. The mission is performed in the following way: men standing there for that purpose hold three spears; other people take the one who is sent to Zalmoxis by his hands and feet and fling him in the air on the spears. If he dies pierced, they think that the divinity is going to help them; if he does not die, it is he who is accused and they declare that he is a bad person... The messenger is told the requests while he is still alive. The same [Dacians], on other occasions, when he thunders and lightens, shoot with arrows up in the air against the sky and menace the divinity because they think there is no god other than their own.",
                "startIntroPart2": "
I am told by the Greeks who dwell on the shores of the Hellespont
and the Pontus, that this Zalmoxis was in reality a man, that he lived
at Samos, and while there was the slave of Pythagoras son of Mnesarchus.
After obtaining his freedom he grew rich, and leaving Samos, returned
to his own country. The Thracians at that time lived in a wretched
way, and were a poor ignorant race; Zalmoxis, therefore, who by his
commerce with the Greeks, and especially with one who was by no means
their most contemptible philosopher, Pythagoras to wit, was acquainted
with the Ionic mode of life and with manners more refined than those
current among his countrymen, had a chamber built, in which from time
to time he received and feasted all the principal Thracians, using
the occasion to teach them that neither he, nor they, his boon companions,
nor any of their posterity would ever perish, but that they would
all go to a place where they would live for aye in the enjoyment of
every conceivable good. While he was acting in this way, and holding
this kind of discourse, he was constructing an apartment underground,
into which, when it was completed, he withdrew, vanishing suddenly
from the eyes of the Thracians, who greatly regretted his loss, and
mourned over him as one dead. He meanwhile abode in his secret chamber
three full years, after which he came forth from his concealment,
and showed himself once more to his countrymen, who were thus brought
to believe in the truth of what he had taught them. Such is the account
of the Greeks. 

I for my part neither put entire faith in this story of Zalmoxis and
his underground chamber, nor do I altogether discredit it: but I believe
Zalmoxis to have lived long before the time of Pythagoras. - Herodotus",
